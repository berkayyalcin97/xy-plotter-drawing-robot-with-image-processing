# XY-Robot-Arm

On the construction and montage of a XY-Plotter Drawingrobot with a GUI, we used a 3D-Printer for manufacturing the parts of the robot. We used image-processing algorithms such as Canny for transforming captured images to vector space so that robot can understand and draw the picture. We have used for GUI and image-processing Python. Our system has 2 Stepper motors on Robot and a servo motor on Gripper of Robot. Motor is controlled by a CNC-Shield that is assembled on Arduino. You can see our end prototype in Video. 
  
I thank my teammates (Berk Kaçka, Ömer Faruk Güngör, Nurdan Ruhten Şeker, Ahmed Astar, Muhammed Saati, Ozge Maden, Batuhan Cengiz, Berkay Yalçın) and our supervisor Dr.-Ing. Soner Emec. It was a great experience and a pleasure to work with them on this project.
